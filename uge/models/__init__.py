"""
Models Package

This package contains data models and business entities for the UGE application.

Models represent the core data structures and business logic of the application:
- Experiment: Represents a GE experiment with its configuration and results
- Dataset: Handles dataset loading, preprocessing, and management
- Grammar: Manages BNF grammar files and parsing

Each model encapsulates data and the operations that can be performed on that data.
